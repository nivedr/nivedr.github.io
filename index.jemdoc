== About me

I am a fourth year Ph.D. student at UC Berkeley, jointly advised by Jiantao Jiao and Kannan Ramchandran. I am affiliated with the BLISS and BAIR labs.

I work on a variety of topics in machine learning with a focus on the statistical and computational aspects of adaptive decision making problems and reinforcement learning. I am also interested in nonconvex optimization and federated learning. I appreciate papers with well motivated theoretical formulations which either explain curious practical phenomena or ultimately provide intuitions missing in existing practical approaches.

I've had the great fortune of working with two amazing undergrads, [https://www.linkedin.com/in/alex-deweese-7313b9208 Alex Deweese] and [https://www.linkedin.com/in/matt-peng-791a47132 Matt Peng]. Alex and I had been thinking about algorithms for online RL with a focus on achieving optimal sample complexity guarantees. Matt and I worked on implementing performant algorithms for Imitation Learning based on a novel technique known as Replay Estimation.

I organize the [https://bliss.eecs.berkeley.edu/Seminar/index.html BLISS seminar] and [http://www.climb.berkeley.edu/seminar CLIMB seminar] at Berkeley. Shoot me an email if you are interested in giving a talk at either venue!

In a previous life, I was a dual degree student at the [http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ Department of Electrical Engineering], [https://www.iitm.ac.in/ IIT Madras]. I am fortunate to have had [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rakri/ Ravishankar Krishnaswamy] and [http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~andrew/ Prof. Andrew Thangaraj] as thesis advisors and work closely with [https://www.tcs.tifr.res.in/~vaze/ Prof. Rahul Vaze].

*I will be participating in the [https://www.aidslifecycle.org/ AIDS LifeCycle 2023]*. You can support me by clicking [https://do.nr/etse1d here]. Every little bit counts!
