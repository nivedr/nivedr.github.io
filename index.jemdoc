== About me

I am currently a second year Ph.D. student, affiliated with the BLISS and BAIR labs. My advisors are Profs. Jiantao Jiao and Kannan Ramachandran.

I was previously a dual degree student at the [http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/ Department of Electrical Engineering], [https://www.iitm.ac.in/ IIT Madras]. I was fortunate to have [https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/rakri/ Ravishankar Krishnaswamy] and [http://www.ee.iitm.ac.in/~andrew/ Prof. Andrew Thangaraj] as my master's thesis advisors.

== Research

I am currently exploring the theory of reinforcement learning. I believe that a succesful work in this area proposes concrete theoretical formulations and ultimately provides intuitions missing in existing practical approaches.
